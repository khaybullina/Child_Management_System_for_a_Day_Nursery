Hello, dear Reader!

This project is dedicated to the creation of a Child Management System for a Day Nursery.
The SQL code creates a database for a day nursery, inserts some data into it, and defines useful database objects. 
For instance, it includes an EVENT that automatically creates a VIEW on a monthly basis, displaying the cost of attendance for the upcoming month.

This work is my final project of the Kickstarter Class "Introduction to Databases and SQL", provided by Code First Girls Ltd. and sponsored by Deloitte.
